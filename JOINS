# Below is the process of finding Rockbusters 'Top 5 Customers' via JOINS

## Starting with finding 'Top 10 Countries' by count of customers
SELECT D.country,
            COUNT (customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

## Getting more granular with "Top 10 Cities" within those 'Top 10 Countries'
SELECT D.country,
        C.city,
        COUNT (customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country, city
HAVING country IN (‘India’, ‘China’, ‘United States’, ‘Japan’, ‘Mexico’, ‘Brazil’, ’Russian Federation’, ‘Phillipines’, ‘Turkey’, ‘Indonesia’)
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

## Finally discovering 'Top 5 Customers' within "Top 10 Cities"
SELECT A.customer_id,
        A.first_name,
        A.last_name,
        D.country,
        C.city
        SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
HAVING city IN
              (‘Aurora’, ‘Acua’, ‘Citrus Heights’, ‘Iwaki’, ‘Ambuturr’, ‘Shanwei’, ‘So Leopoldo’, ‘Teboksary’, ‘Tianjin’, ‘Cianjur’)
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5;
